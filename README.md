# FASE_Coursework

> **Note :warning:**: This is an academic project created while I was studying Software Engineering. The SDK versions and build tools reflect the time of development and are documented as-is for historical accuracy. It is not live nor will it be maintained any further.

This repository contains coursework for creating software for an atomic train - a train control system with a nuclear reactor power source. The project was developed using Ada with SPARK Mode for formal verification.

## Project Overview

This academic project demonstrates:
- Nuclear reactor control systems
- Train management (speed, carriages)
- Safety-critical software design with formal verification
- Concurrent task programming in Ada

The codebase includes reactor management, train operations, and a main control interface demonstrating real-time system interactions.
